description: Being a Software Engineer, I had this wonderful experience of working as a PM, interacting with various stakeholders, being a Scrum Master and implementing sophisticated features. The products were built from absolute scratch to a successful MVP in a matter of 10 months.(PrivacyForMe,PiEye Cookie Compliance) The application onboarding and setup were 10x faster and easier than its competitors. Onboarded 6-7 e-commerce retailers to set up their compliance within 2 months of product launch.
